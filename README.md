# Machine-Learning
This repo is a compilation of the all the **Machine Learning** stuff covered during my first-year at IIT Gandhinagar

## The Overview
The compilation of six major works in **Machine Learning**, as accomplished during the **March - April 2023** at **Indian Institute of Technology
Gandhinagar**, is contained in this repository. The Jupyter Notebooks include topics ranging from **building and understanding**
several famous **clustering, dimensionality reduction models** from scratch to **fine tuning hyperparameters of a model** and finally building a
**Convolutional Neural Network**.

## EigenFaces and PCA
The [EigenFaces_MyPCA Notebook](EigenFaces_MyPCA.ipynb) and the [Eigenfaces_MyPCA PDF](Eigenfaces_MyPCA.pdf) started out as an exploration into understanding the **EigenFace
Algorithm** from scratch. Each step from **scaling the original data matrix** to finding the **eigenvectors** and **eigenvalues** of its **covariance matrix** have been covered in great detail with examples and commentary.

## Clustering and PCA
The [Clustering_PCA Notebook](Clustering_PCA.ipynb) and the [Clustering_PCA PDF](Clustering_PCA.pdf) consist of in-depth building up of the
**KMeans clustering** algorithm and the **dimensionality reduction technique : Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** from scratch. The **load_wine dataset** consisting of original **13 dimensions** had been reduced to **2 and 3 dimensions** using PCA and clustering had been performed on this low dimensional data. The Clusters and the Cluster Centers have been plotted for visual aid too.
